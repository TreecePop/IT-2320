<h1>What interests me?</h1>
<h2>Animals!</h2>
</div>
<br>

<p>Ever since I was young I had a love for animals and it has never faded. I enjoyed watching Animal Planet after school to learn all I could about them, and an all time favorite were the Conformation Dog Shows, like Westminster Kennel Club.</p>

<p>There are so many different animals too...</p>
<br>

<ul >
	<li>Cats</li>
	<li>Dogs</li>
	<li>Bears</li>
	<li>Tigers</li>
	<li>Caracals</li>
	<li>Otters</li>
	<li>Ducks</li>
	<li>Etcetera...</li>
</ul>
<br>

<p>...and they all serve a different purpose in this world.</p>

<p>With that said, dogs and cats are all over, on the streets and in shelters. Animal Shelters do a lot for the animals that are waiting for their new homes, and many animal lovers do their part to help by donating and volunteering, and of course by adopting.</p>
<br>

<p>As much as I'd love to volunteer and foster a few more animals, I'm busy as it is between work, school, and the 2 furballs of my own that I take care of!</p>
